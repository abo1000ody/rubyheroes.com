    ### What is this about? ###

     There are many people in the Ruby/Rails world who contribute to our
     community and rarely receive any recognition or payment for their work.
     
     They create educational content, develop plugins & gems, contribute to
     open source projects, and even put on events which help educate and make
     our lives as developers easier.
     
     Ruby Heroes was created to show some gratitude and give these people the
     recognition they deserve. Hopefully the type of recognition that keeps
     them doing what theyâ€™re doing, and continuing to make our community
     stronger.
     
     Based on the nominations you give here, #{link_to "the previous Ruby
     Heroes", heroes_path} will pick 6 people who will receive a Ruby Hero
     Award at [RailsConf](http://en.oreilly.com/rails2011/) this year.
